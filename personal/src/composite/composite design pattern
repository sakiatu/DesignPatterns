Step 01: Design the interface that defines the overall type : Structure.java
Step 02: Implements the interface in composite class : Housing.java is the composite class
         composite class contains a list of itself.

         The composite design pattern is used to solve the issues of how to build
         a tree-like structure of objects, and how to treat the individual types of
         those objects uniformly.

     * composite class can contain multiple composite class : Housing.java
     * leaf class dont contain any class : Room.java
